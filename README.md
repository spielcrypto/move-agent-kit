## Installation

### Using NPM
```bash
npm install move-agent-kit
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Metamove/move-agent-kit
cd move-agent-kit
npm i
```


## Quick Start

### Basic Setup
First, import the necessary modules:

```typescript
const aptosConfig = new AptosConfig({
	network: Network.MAINNET,
});

const aptos = new Aptos(aptosConfig);

const account = await aptos.deriveAccountFromPrivateKey({
	privateKey: new Ed25519PrivateKey(
		PrivateKey.formatPrivateKey(
			process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
			PrivateKeyVariants.Ed25519,
		),
	),
});
```
### Configure Your Environment
Create a configuration file .env in your project root:

```typescript
APTOS_PRIVATE_KEY="private key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="API Key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="API Key"

// check docs here: https://github.com/econia-labs/emojicoin-dot-fun?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODULE_ADDRESS="0xface729284ae5729100b3a9ad7f7cc025ea09739cd6e7252aff0beb53619cafe"
NEXT_PUBLIC_REWARDS_MODULE_ADDRESS="0xbabe32dbe1cb44c30363894da9f49957d6e2b94a06f2fc5c20a9d1b9e54cface"
NEXT_PUBLIC_INTEGRATOR_ADDRESS="0x99994f5124fa5cc95538217780cbfc01e4c4f842dfcc453890755b2ce4779999"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ARENA_MODULE_ADDRESS="0x0" # Emojicoin arena is not on mainnet yet.
NEXT_PUBLIC_INTEGRATOR_FEE_RATE_BPS="100"
``` 

### Initialize the Client

```typescript
const signer = new LocalSigner(account, Network.MAINNET);
const agent = new AgentRuntime(signer, aptos, {
	PANORA_API_KEY: process.env.PANORA_API_KEY, // optional
	OPENAI_API_KEY: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY // optional
});
const tools = createAptosTools(aptosAgent);
```

### Basic Operations Examples
#### Token Transfer

```typescript
const result = agent.transferTokens("to_address", 1.0)
```

#### Read Blockchain Data

```typescript
// Get Balance
const balance = agent.getBalance("0x123...")

// Get transaction details
const tx_info = agent.transferTokens("0x789...")
```

## LangChain Integration

```typescript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const llm = new ChatAnthropic({
    temperature: 0.7,
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
});

const memory = new MemorySaver();

const agent = createReactAgent({
    llm,
    tools,
    checkpointSaver: memory,
    messageModifier: `
        You are a helpful agent that can interact onchain using the Aptos Agent Kit. You are
        empowered to interact onchain using your tools. If you ever need funds, you can request them from the
        faucet. If not, you can provide your wallet details and request funds from the user. If there is a 5XX
        (internal) HTTP error code, ask the user to try again later. If someone asks you to do something you
        can't do with your currently available tools, you must say so, and encourage them to implement it
        themselves using the Aptos Agent Kit, recommend they go to https://metamove.build/move-agent-kit for more information. Be
        concise and helpful with your responses. Refrain from restating your tools' descriptions unless it is explicitly requested.
    `,
});

const stream = await agent.stream(
    {
        messages: [new HumanMessage("Deposit 10 APT on Joule")],
    },
    config
);

for await (const chunk of stream) {
    if ("agent" in chunk) {
        console.log(chunk.agent.messages[0].content);
    } else if ("tools" in chunk) {
        console.log(chunk.tools.messages[0].content);
    }
    console.log("-------------------");
}
```
